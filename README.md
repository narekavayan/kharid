# Project: kharid.com

This is the GitHub repository for the project you named "kharid", generated from the "yaxt-demo" website template at [yax.com](https://yax.com).

From here, deploy your website for free hosting. Just click a button to deploy your website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Render.com](https://render.com/). During the process, you will create a second repo for deployment. Name it what you like; I suggest "kharid-deploy".

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/narekavayan/kharid)

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/narekavayan/kharid)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

# Yax Template Demo

This is the first template designed for the [yax.com](https://yax.com/) website builder project.

The template includes the [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) website editor so you can edit content on the website.
